# f1_racesim-basic
This project is a standalone Formula 1 race simulator built with Python and OpenCV. It creates a dynamic, real-time visualization of a simplified F1 race, complete with a live timing tower, telemetry data, overtake detection, and an F1-style graphical HUD.

It's a fun demonstration of how to use Python for real-time graphical simulations and data visualization.

✨ Features

✅ Real-time vehicle tracking on an elliptical track.

✅ A live timing tower showing driver positions and gaps to the leader.

✅ On-screen speed and lap telemetry for the lead car.

✅ Accurate lap timing, best lap tracking, and a "fastest lap" indicator.

✅ Automatic detection and logging of overtakes.

✅ A mini track map for a bird's-eye view of all car positions.

✅ A clean, F1-style Heads-Up Display (HUD).

✅ Option to save the simulation as an MP4 video file.
