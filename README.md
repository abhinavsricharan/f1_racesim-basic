# f1_racesim-basic
This project is a standalone Formula 1 race simulator built with Python and OpenCV. It creates a dynamic, real-time visualization of a simplified F1 race, complete with a live timing tower, telemetry data, overtake detection, and an F1-style graphical HUD.

It's a fun demonstration of how to use Python for real-time graphical simulations and data visualization.

‚ú® Features

‚úÖ Real-time vehicle tracking on an elliptical track.

‚úÖ A live timing tower showing driver positions and gaps to the leader.

‚úÖ On-screen speed and lap telemetry for the lead car.

‚úÖ Accurate lap timing, best lap tracking, and a "fastest lap" indicator.

‚úÖ Automatic detection and logging of overtakes.

‚úÖ A mini track map for a bird's-eye view of all car positions.

‚úÖ A clean, F1-style Heads-Up Display (HUD).

‚úÖ Option to save the simulation as an MP4 video file.


Of course! Here is a README file suitable for a GitHub repository for your F1 Race Simulation project.
